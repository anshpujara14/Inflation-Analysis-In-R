Deflation is more harmful and dangerous for an economy because it means that the prices of goods and services are going to decrease. Now this sounds amazing for consumers like us. But what actually happens is that the demand of goods and services have declined over a long term of time. 
                            This directly indicates that a recession is on its way. This brings job losses , declining wages and a big hit to the stock portfolio. Deflation slows economy's growth. As prices fall , people defer(postpone) purchases in hope of a better lower price deal. Due to this companies and firms have to cut
